< l > How's the coronavirus panic in [redacted]?

< mkgll > Not too bad it seems. I was at a country club the other night and some rich boomers were having a blast. 

< mkgll > Things are mostly open. People are still out, as they should be.

< l > [redacted] is going full boomer and scoffing at the whole thing

< mkgll > I'm scoffing too!

< l > lol

< mkgll > I'm more worried about people causing an economic collapse than the virus

< l > I don't think it's that bad but I don't think it's nothing either

< mkgll > I think it's nothing, in the sense that it's not worth *shutting down the whole world* for it, but we'll see. 

< l > Supposedly it can really mess up your lungs.

< mkgll > All the early conclusions are silly. I read they're saying 1/10 people will get sick because 1/10 people tested were getting "diagnosed." But they're only testing people who are already really sick! 

< mkgll > Anyway I just think that the real threat is what comes next. All the pundits are clamoring for a totalitarian Uberstadt that has random medical screening and all sorts of other draconian shit in the future.
