You realise when you start blocking or muting most journalists on Twitter just how many of them are really out there! Everyday there's a new Buzzfeed busybody clogging up my feed with fake scandal, privacy invasions, and BS mongering that I need to block or mute. I pray one day to reach the end of the line and have a largely journalist-free internet experience.
