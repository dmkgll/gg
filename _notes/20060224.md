We'll be doing the [Positron Task Force](https://cityofheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Positron_Task_Force) TOMORROW. Start 9pm Eastern assuming I make it back from Colorado in time. Let me know you're joining. You can bring friends but only after all spots from ArcticAvengers members are taken. GunDragon, Starshower, Falcon Medic already have spots saved. Let me know soon.
