I walked into a Lego store the other day and can't believe how much they have improved since I played with them as a kid. The printing, detailing, accuracy of series like Star Wars, etc, is incredible. I almost feel like I missed out! Just to mess around, I picked up the Endor Bunker set, which I tried to build on my own as a kid with some success.
