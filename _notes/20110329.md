I recently finished reading *Notes from the Underground* by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I have to admit I don't yet fully understand it and I'll need some further reflection. It is definitely in my top 10 favorite novels. 

Go to Barnes and Noble today. Yes today, and buy the Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky translation.  I'll post more on the novel soon.
