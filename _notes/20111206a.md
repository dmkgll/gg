If you look at history, some of the first governmental regulations began from problems created by government itself. Controls necessitated further controls. The ICC was created to control businessmen who were allowed to grow so out of control because of government aid. Businessmen were put on the ICC board and they were able to effectively cripple competition. Then further regulations were developed. These controls made it harder and harder for new businesses to start, and it made people resort to bribery in order to get accredited. If you need justification for that, just look at the development of the trucking industry. The businessmen on the ICC put restrictions on who could own trucks, and only those with the most money or political pull were able to get involved. 

You simply must trace government control back to it's roots. It became "necessary" because of prior government interference.
