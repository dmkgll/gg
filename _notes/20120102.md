You know it's interesting, people love suffering. They love stories of adversity, they love to have to overcome, just so long as its not them and it's someone else. Nothing raises someone so high in someone's eyes as the extent to which they have suffered. People are always trying to deny the bad parts of the story, not, persay, the sufferings, but the causes of them. It's always some external force beyond my control. The story can't be disrupted if there's no flaw in the character. Interesting that we spend so much time denying our flaws in an attempt to create a perfect story, but many of the protagonists in our most beloved fictions have some sort of flaws or some woes that plague them. It's only okay for other people to have woes, or for us to exaggerate ours to fit in. Nobody actually wants to suffer like the characters they idealize.
