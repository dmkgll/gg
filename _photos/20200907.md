I ran into Roger Ver today in Barcelona and got to guest host the Bitcoin.com Weekly Show today with him Mate Tokay off the coast! September 7th is a lucky day for me. Last year this exact day I ran into the writer of Braveheart in Hawaii and spent an hour talking to him about the creative process, apprenticeship instead of college, and the backstory of writing the film.
