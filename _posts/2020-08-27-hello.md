title: Hello again, world!
---

I’m back. Well, to be more specific, I’m back to writing.

I’ve been “back” for about a year or so, but despite my best intentions and promises, I’ve failed to start up regular writing again on my own domain and under my own name.

To be fair to myself, I’ve been busy. I’ll get into all that, why I took a break, where I’ve been, and everything else here on my blog and on my newsletter (sign up!).
