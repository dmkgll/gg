She's amazing. Her passion is exactly what I felt was lacking in my Classics departments at college. It's infectious and inspiring. Incidentally, she was not allowed to go to graduate school because she was a woman. She went on to be granted honorary citizenship to Athens for her work (and she didn't start writing until her sixties!)
