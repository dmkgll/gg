[@isaacmorehouse](https://twitter.com/isaacmorehouse) [@tk_coleman](https://twitter.com/tk_coleman) It's astonishing how uncreative many can be when thinking about law. Sorry, no, the anarchocapitalist argument is not that there should be "no laws," "no courts," or that "anything goes." That's such an embarrassing strawman I can't seriously believe anyone thinks it.
