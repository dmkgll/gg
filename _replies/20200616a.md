[@digitsu](https://twitter.com/digitsu) "Money velocity" is not a very useful concept here. It is individuals' preferences and actions that determine the prices of goods (including money) and not velocity. All we can say about Bitcoin and "money velocity" is that the *potential velocity* adds to the quality of Bitcoin as money, not that any particular state or measurement of velocity at any point in time is what determines the value of Bitcoin.
