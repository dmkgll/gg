blockquote: I am being very open in my cowardice here that I do not want to be blamed for "doxing" Scott Alexander himself but if all the hundreds of people who know his real last name just started saying it we could put an end to this ridiculous farce

[@arthur_affect](https://twitter.com/arthur_affect) Open secrets are still *secrets,* otherwise anything goes in doxxing because almost all information is "public" to someone. Family member knows your address? Well that means it's public information and I can post it online!... If you have to work hard to find the information, it counts as a dox. NYT criminals should leave Scott (whose blog I've never really read) alone.
