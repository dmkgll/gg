[@nayafia](https://twitter.com/nayafia/status/1273304859387719680) I look forward to reading this and just pre-ordered. Incidentally, you've got a great publisher. I've been impressed with the quality of [@stripepress](https://twitter.com/stripepress) books. Acid-free paper and sewn (albeit a bit tight) bindings. Hardcovers should be made to last.
