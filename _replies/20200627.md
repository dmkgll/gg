Thanks [@john.](https://parler.com/profile/John/posts) I'm curious how Parler plans to avoid becoming the next Gab cesspool? I love upstart social media for free expression, but early adopters are often disproportionately some of the most toxic people on the internet. Many of us aren't looking for an alt-right shitpost service. We just hate the information manipulation, though control and outrage mobs that rule Twitter. I hope you succeed. You have an uphill battle.
