blockquote:  One of the main attractions about this product is that itâ€™s privacy-focused. For me, that alone justifies the price (as it does with services like ProtonMail).

Hey has some nice privacy features, for sure. It's paid (though they should add Bitcoin support), which means it's less liable to get corrupted by backroom ad deals. It blocks trackers. But can we really say a service located in the U.S. is "privacy focused?"
