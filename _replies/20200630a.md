blockquote: I'm not loving Hey, but I'm ready to quit gmail. Any thoughts on Fastmail vs Protonmail? Or another suggestion?

[@cagrimmett](https://twitter.com/cagrimmett) I haven't enjoyed Hey either. I used Fastmail all of 2019 for several thousand emails and loved it. It had everything I needed, and it's more comparable to gmail than Protonmail or Tutanota.
