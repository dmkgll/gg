[@cagrimmett](https://twitter.com/cagrimmett) If you try ProtonMail, make sure to go to https://beta.protonmail.com to see the latest UX updates. Quite a bit different than old. You can also see their new calendar tool. And they have VPN. The heavy privacy emails have tradeoffs so unless you really want that, go Fastmail.
