blockquote: Blocks lead to value. 2GB likely 1k GBP a BSV. 100GB likely 2.5k GBP a BSV. 100GB likely 10k GBP a BSV. It is value through use.

Craig either has a wacky platonistic view of Bitcoin price, or he's just intentionally feeding the sycophants in his chatroom with BS. Either way, this is nonsense. Prices don't work like this. We really can't say anything about price of BSV and blocksize other than that limited blocks will likely put a ceiling on price, since demand and utility would scale inversely to eachother.
