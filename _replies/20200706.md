blockquote: I'll make a confession. Before turning into a complete #Bitcoin maximalist a year ago I was a shitcoiner (despite mining my first #btc in '13). Different handle, life, time, & I was trolled a lot, it pushed me away, deeper into shitcoins. It wasn't easy to arrive to where I am rn

If anyone wants to put in the time, I'll put in money and some research time for a database of outrageous and unironic "Bitcoin maximalist" tweets like this one. "I'll make a confession..." ðŸ˜‚ The religiosity is truly something you wouldn't believe until you saw how widespread it is.
